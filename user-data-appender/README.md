# user-data-appender
Appends additional user MS Profile data to a CSV or Excel list. The app now includes a backup email domain input (defaults to
`@tcco.com`) so profile lookups try the pasted/uploaded email first, then automatically retry the same username with the
fallback domain if the first attempt fails.
